# CS-255_Final
CS-255 Portfolio Submission
This project was commited to ensuring the fictional company DriverPass, a currently operating driving school that wanted to add an LMS to their current cirriculum. They wanted this system to work alongside their current system, allowing customers to purchase various packages for in-person driving lessons and help taking practice tests for the DMV online etc. I believe I ensured that the system I designed will meet all of DriverPasses needs. If I could choose one thing to revise in these documents it might be the functional requirements, as that was one portion I struggled coming up with more than just two answers with, or difficutly elabortaing more on short topics. The entire system is based around the Users needs. When you're designing a system it is incredibly important to consider who is going to use the system and how. You are desinging a system to be used, not to sit around, and if not designed correctly it can't be used correctly. When I design software this is the main thing I'm thinking about the entire time. A system should be optimized to meet the users needs for the users using it.
